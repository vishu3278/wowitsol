A big thanks to the Internet, connectivity, and technology because of which the online businesses are flourishing day by day. The integration of Internet and technology has boosted the graph of the online market. The businesses are adopting the technologies to reach their customers in every possible way. They try to reach their customers through the website, develop mobile apps for their businesses or even reach them personally through their inbox (email or SMS).<br />\r\nMany people feel that you don&rsquo;t need a mobile app; you just need a website that looks good on mobile devices. Others say that mobile apps have benefits that a website cannot provide. Who is right?<br />\r\nEveryone needs a responsive website that looks great on mobile. It&rsquo;s not really that hard to get a responsive website, and there are no downsides.<br />\r\nPeople are going to view your website on their devices, and you need to support that. It&rsquo;s obvious that you need a responsive website, but do you also need a mobile app? Is a mobile app better than your mobile website?<br />\r\nThis is the dilemma of almost every startup &ndash; Website or Mobile App? And the answer to itis even more confusing perhaps. The more you wade through the data and trends, more you are going to get confused. Apart from all the analytical observations, I recommend you believe in your gut instinct. Analyze your startup idea, understand your potential customer&rsquo;s preferences, and go ahead with confidence.

It also includes the entire online process of developing, marketing, selling, delivering, servicing and paying for products and services. India has shown tremendous growth in the E-commerce segment. With an internet user base of over 300 million, India has third largest internet population after US &amp; China.<br />\r\nThe decades between 1950 to 1990 were dominated by the Global trading organizations, especially from Japan. There was a time when these trading organizations dominated world&rsquo;s top 10 organizations on the Fortune 500 list. The main reason for their dominance was their powers in the areas of information and communication.<br />\r\nThe decade of the nineties saw the emergence of the Internet as the means of universal communication and information. The power source of the Japanese trading firms was gradually lost when the Internet started becoming almost universal in the application in the business communities world over.<br />\r\nWithout a doubt, a variety of ongoing developments are feeding into the overall growth of the e-commerce sector. Businesses are not just focusing on a digital store selling some nice- enough items, but instead, they&rsquo;re trying to create new markets, plug the unexplored terrains, create a shopping experience that consumers can enjoy as they browse, provide round-the-clock services and meet the overall customer service expectations at all times-<br />\r\nbefore, during, and after a purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-commerce sales continue to grow on a yearly basis, yet despite this, only 7.7% of all retail sales took place online in the US in the first quarter of 2016.1 that means e-commerce has a lot of room to grow if it is to catch up with non-digital retail sales. In order to determine what direction this growth will take, we investigated the current e-commerce trends and their impact on the market.<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s no doubt that Augmented Reality is the next big thing in the technology world. I&rsquo;m not saying this because of being a Black Mirror fan, but because every other week there&rsquo;s a new AR app released and what used to be a futuristic dream seems to be finally coming true.<br />\r\nSo what if you are running an e-commerce store or you are a retailer, what can you do to prevent yourself from being out-of-business in the next five years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, if I was a retailer, I would start investing in becoming a brand, meaning I would take a significant part of my profits and pour it into R&amp;D to create new products. As a retailer, you already have the benefit of knowing what sells and what doesn&rsquo;t. So why not start your own brand that might be Private Label at first and move into creating your own unique products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, I would start focussing on aligning myself with the gatekeepers like Amazon, Google, and Apple. You could sell your products on Amazon as an FBA, become a Retailer that works together with Google Express and integrate Apple Pay into your App, Website, and Store.<br />\r\nThird, I would figure out, which IoT devices, I would be able to collaborate with. If I am selling perishables or detergent, I would reach out to LG or Samsung to provide products and figure out how packaging can work together with the device. Coffee beans, washing detergent or even microwave meals, could collaborate and become the product of choice<br />\r\nfor the IoT devices of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-Commerce is here to stay with WOW IT solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Social Media: Majority of online buying decisions are made on Social Media. Social network like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest etc have become a medium for easy log-in and purchase.</li>\r\n	<li>Drone Delivery: Companies have been working their way around to innovate the delivery process to shorten human effort as well as time. The answer to these problems is Delivery by Drones. DGCA is now fast-tracking the process of issuing guidelines for the use of drones for civil purposes in India.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;App only Approach: Statistics suggest the future of internet lies in mobiles. Experts say more than 580 million people in India will use the Internet by 2018, and 70-80% of them will access the Web on mobile phones. This will cause all major players to switch to app only model.</li>\r\n	<li>Google&#39;s Buy Now Button: Google is reportedly working on its own &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; style&nbsp;button that would allow e-shoppers search for products on Google and purchase them with a single click, right through Google&rsquo;s own search results page.</li>\r\n	<li>Artificial Intelligence: As the e-commerce space gets saturated, investors looking for innovative use of technology are zeroing in on companies developing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next 5 years we likely won&rsquo;t see any drastic changes to e-commerce or how we buy<br />\r\ngoods in general; however, we&rsquo;ll see early adopters begin to experiment with what<br />\r\nconsumers will use in the next 10-20 years.

What they might not understand is that the concept of e-commerce has grown immensely in recent years. Most business, be they large or small; perform at least some transactions online, whether business to consumer or B2B services and products. Even local brands and indie bands can set up a small e-store to sell merchandise directly to their followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing opportunity, but the sheer size of the market makes for a lot of competition and ample opportunity to make mistakes. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, the overwhelming choice is enough to freeze your efforts in their tracks. You&rsquo;ll have to work smart if you want your e-commerce strategy to succeed, so today, we&rsquo;re going to cover seven essential steps for improving your site, increasing your revenues, and rising to the top of the e-commerce ladder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more customers turn to the internet for purchasing, the consumer market is fast evolving to e-commerce solutions. More businesses are expanding online; products and services now available via the click of a button or the swipe of a finger. For business planning to enter the e-commerce space, the process can be a bit overwhelming. While selling online provides countless opportunities for brands and retailers, businesses that seek to take advantage of the benefits that e-commerce offers need to address some critical questions to improve their e-commerce strategy and boost their<br />\r\nbusiness.<br />\r\nSome of the key elements of an e-commerce marketing strategy are templates, marketing, email, content, social media, personal interaction, using multiple content channels, mobile marketing, and search engine optimization.<br />\r\nFollowing Strategies are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Go for &lsquo;Mobile apps&rsquo;:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to make your e-commerce platform applicable to the mobile market. People do a lot of shopping from their phones these days, and if your website can navigate mobile markets by itself being easy to use from mobile devices, you can definitely see some profit. If you haven&rsquo;t yet adapted to a mobile market, it would be very wise to do so. The fact that customers can make purchases via their smartphone or tablet from anywhere and at any time. This makes the mobile key to achieving growth in e-commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Social Media Marketing:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Not jumping on the board could mean missing out on the massive opportunities that social media offers. Implementing a social media advertising strategy that is focused on improving engagement for your e-commerce business can be an effective way to drive traffic to your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Offer Deals:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone likes to get a deal. That&rsquo;s why it seems like stores are constantly running sales and promotions. They&rsquo;re trying to get you in the door and to the checkout counter, and you can do the same with your e-commerce store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re first starting out and trying to develop a loyal customer base, being competitive on price is key to making sales. Consider offering a discount or running a promotion and displaying it clearly on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Creative Content:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>E-commerce websites will benefit from a blog &ndash; that much is true. But for those who don&rsquo;t have enough time or attention to run a blog, educating with high-quality content doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;content marketing.&rdquo;<br />\r\nHigh-quality visual content would do the same. As you know, people&rsquo;s attention span is usually low on text but high on visual aids. So, if you create images instead of plain texts in your content, you are capturing much of this attention span and motivate people to shop with you while you educate them.<br />\r\nBe concise but be informative at the same time. Caption the images in a way that it will not look messy or cluttered. Images should contain information that will tell customers what the product is but at the same time entice them to get to know it more.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Give importance to customer feedback:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential customers read reviews a lot and it can assist the buying process making it easier and more convenient to decide.<br />\r\nPeople appreciate feedback from real people who have bought and used the same product. Make sure that your customers can see these reviews prominently on the product page that they are&nbsp;viewing. This can greatly influence the customers&rsquo; decision to buy the item or divert their attention unto a related item. Utilize a friendly &ndash; customer service tone throughout the pages of your e-commerce site so the customers will always feel valued and important. Including a personal touch to every page of your website is a must-have.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Go after those abandoned carts:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A potential customer browses your site, loads up their shopping cart with a few purchases, but fails to follow through. Oh well, guess that&rsquo;s a customer lost, right? Wrong. You can (and should) pursue &ldquo;abandoned carts&rdquo; as the potential revenue is substantial.<br />\r\nFirst, make sure that your shopping cart is easy to navigate. Putting hurdles in the way of checkout is one of the primary annoyances that cause consumers to &ldquo;tap out&rdquo; and abandon the process. Cut down on the endless forms, implement a plethora of payment options, and watch your failure rate decrease.<br />\r\nFor those that still abandon ship, hope is not lost. There are plenty of ways to win back customers, chief of which are friendly reminders that they haven&rsquo;t made a purchase. You needn&rsquo;t go through the hassle of sending these out yourself, though. There are plenty of add-ons and third-party software that will help you draft, schedule, and send the perfect reminder emails to re-engage those more elusive consumers.</p>\r\n', 'QQEM1529307573.jpg', 'publish', '2018-06-18 13:09:33', '2018-06-18 13:09:33'),

Within this ever-advancing spectrum, web design trends quickly move from &lsquo;in vogue&rsquo; to &lsquo;old fashioned&rsquo;. What was top-of-the-line yesterday has most likely dropped down in order today and everyone wants only the best. User-friendly websites are just the basic norm now. Be it<br />\r\nexperimentation or innovation, the web design spectrum is skyrocketing with new ideas and strategies that keep viewers engaged.<br />\r\nEvery website&rsquo;s success is owed to its design. Engaging viewers is a direct result of designs that are in vogue and make navigation easier. It&rsquo;s easier said than done though. The trends keep changing and the expectations keep rising. The expectation from web designers is rapidly soaring and we need to keep up.<br />\r\nIn this information society, people usually live in a rapid-paced life. Every industry would face constant update, change, and development, not to mention the internet industry. Today, I would like to talk about what the exact trends of latest web designs. Good website designs can make your websites stand out from the furious competition and win more<br />\r\nattention of your company. However, it is not easy to make an unique web design, because designers always have their own web design styles. Due to this, you should always look for some new trend to improve your design website technology and attract the maximum quantity of your target users. Seizing the right direction of the change of market and figuring out what kind of design they prefer would help you not be ignored in the new web design<br />\r\ntrends.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>More mobile-first approach.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Smartphones (for the most part) come with significantly smaller screens than tablets and desktops, which limit the amount of content a user can easily view at once. This forces brands to do-away with any information or content which isn&rsquo;t 100% necessary, allowing them to add it in, along with the additional visual bells and whistles for users as they switch up to larger screened devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Responsive design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The surely responsive design is something which has been around for a few years, but this year it&#39;s even bigger uptake in the number of brands, both big and small, who are building responsive-based sites. This helps to achieve the rankings in a search that they desire, as well as keep those all-important customers happy with the user experience</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The popularity of prototyping tools.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Rapid prototyping tools allow designers to quickly create working low and high fidelity prototypes of sites and services to gauge their usability and aesthetic, all without writing a single line of code. Many also allow you to design in the browser and then actually launch the site itself right from the tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Custom illustrations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Talented illustrators are able to create illustrations which are full of personality and tailored to match the tone of the brand, something which brands will be striving for more than an ever in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Dribbble now is a good place to see what kinds of illustrations the worlds best are working on. This is usually a good indicator of the styles and trends which will grow in popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Animations expanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Animations come in all different shape, sizes, and styles, and can all serve different purposes. Animations can range from tiny loading-devices which entertain the user while waiting for content to load, to an interesting hover-state used as a UX device to show a userthey&rsquo;re hovering over a link.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Asymmetric layouts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>What exactly constitutes as a &lsquo;broken layout&rsquo; will vary by designer and project, but they&nbsp;generally involve organizing elements and content to a loose underlying baseline grid which acts as a starting point to move and manipulate content for the desired effect. With these unconventional layouts, designers can overlay typography, imagery, and other content to create unique juxtapositions and layouts which draw attention and generate interest. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to know that most designers are quite keen to explore only the most contemporary trends. There&rsquo;s no room for being old-fashioned in this fast evolving web<br />\r\ndesign space and WOW IT solutions are performing all those strategies. Fortunately orunfortunately, the value of conservative designs is dropping and most designers are catching the new age bus with much eagerness.<br />\r\nHowever, the advantages of the ever-changing trends are numerous. It keeps creativity alive; it constantly defies complacent design habits and quite literally, keeps us on our toes by pulling us out of our comfort zones. That is where the true possibility of excellence lies. A constant improvisation of skills is what every web designer stands to gain from fluid trends. A definite avoidance is observed towards flashy designs, limited browser, and device designs, and standard, static pages can be observed across the board. Whether it&rsquo;s unstructured, open-ended layouts, creative typography, defiant color choices, or imagery infused with life, everything is aimed at ultimately providing users with an engaging website. Rules are being bent; boundaries are being stretched &ndash; all towards the aim of evolving to<br />\r\nhigher design spheres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopt one, some or all, that&rsquo;s your choice, but it&rsquo;s enough to say that these are the ruling<br />\r\ntrends of our time.</p>\r\n', 'VEXQ1530093297.jpg', 'publish', '2018-06-27 15:06:03', '2018-06-27 15:24:57'),

Truly harnessing large volumes of data quickly and accurately enough to permanently affect your online revenue through acquisition, conversion, and retention of consumers, is a complex and expensive endeavor, often<br />\r\navailable only to the largest of companies.<br />\r\nAI holds a ton of promise to allow marketers an easier and smarter path to revenue generation.<br />\r\nMeanwhile, Predictive Personalization is being touted as the next major wave of innovation. AI points to a future in which machines can learn from past interactions and data, allowing marketers to help consumers not only with what they say they want but to anticipate their future needs -- by connecting the various disconnected interactions a consumer has with a brand, into one consistent stream of messaging that transitions with them as they move<br />\r\nfrom device to device.<br />\r\nMarketing departments face an imperative to integrate predictive marketing solutions into the fabric of their campaigns, in order to remain on par with consumer expectations.<br />\r\nInnovations are training consumers to expect more from online businesses, and they are creating a new standard of expectation where marketers must anticipate consumer needs.<br />\r\nAI-driven predictive marketing makes this possible by analyzing historical data and applying what is learned to move a consumer toward the desired interaction.<br />\r\nBecause there are many products marketers can choose from, I recommend checking 4 core competencies when choosing your next AI product that boosts conversion.<br />\r\nDoes the tool allow you to operate independently as a marketer?<br />\r\nSilo-ed data sources limit companies&rsquo; ability to properly leverage their visitor profile.

An effective AI platform keeps marketing in the hands of marketers and not in the hands of CMS and Analytics teams.<br />\r\n<strong>Does it connect data?</strong><br />\r\nMarketing data often resides within a mix of cloud and on-premise systems. All of that data<br />\r\nhas to be connected to create a single view of each consumer and leverage predictive<br />\r\nmarketing opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does it focus on the visitor?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many businesses, AI may seem not only out of reach but also overly complicated. AI for marketing needs to be pared down to visitor journeys and predictive notifications. Is it predictive?<br />\r\nBeyond collecting high volumes of data, companies must have the tools and expertise to analyze and act on it. Advances in AI-based predictive marketing tools make it possible for marketers to work without requiring an army of data scientists, so should your next AI platform.<br />\r\nMost analytics tools require you to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; information out of them, run repeated cohort analysis (such as AB Testing); while the most intelligent predictive tools analyze data and &ldquo;push&rdquo; notifications to your consumers, anticipating what they need. With machine learning, an intelligent software platform can take this customer data in its entirety and build predictive models on it, operating not just on what&rsquo;s been programmed in rules, but also adapting to visitor behavior on the fly, based on what has been learned. Intent builds this precise platform.<br />\r\nSmart businesses know that AI can improve a lot of areas of the e-commerce experience, some of which are:<br />\r\n<strong>1. Virtual buying</strong><br />\r\nFrom browsing through products to the final act of the purchase, customers of e-commerce stores go through various processes of comparing and evaluating. AI is extremely helpful in these situations where customers need and crave information to justify their purchase. AI powers virtual assistants, or bots and apps that provide customers information to help them during the buying process.<br />\r\n<strong>2. Customer conversation</strong><br />\r\nA meaningful conversation is crucial to making a strong connection with any customer. With a large number of people being entertained by your reps, it&rsquo;s hard to expect them to always be on top of their game. Fortunately, AI exists to help them do better. Voice recognition, natural language processing, and chatbots are AI innovations in customer experience that can help companies ensure that every conversation is relevant and responsive to the client&rsquo;s needs.<br />\r\n<strong>3. Targeted marketing</strong><br />\r\nWonder why every ad that pops on your device seems connected to the websites youvisited this week? Or why do you get emails about things you looked up on the internet? AI is the answer. AI knows where you&rsquo;ve been, and where you&rsquo;ve been looking, and it&rsquo;s customizing what you see to suit your interests and follow your patterns. If businesses can read their customers&rsquo; minds, then they must have AI in their system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these technologies powered by AI contribute to making the e-commerce experience more fruitful for both the customer and your company.<br />\r\nHere are a few ways AI can offer real value to your customers:<br />\r\n1.

It helps with dynamic pricing wherein you gauge the price of a commodity on your competitor&rsquo;s portal, product sales, and customer behavior pattern.<br />\r\n<strong>Improved Offers</strong><br />\r\nCustomer acquisition and retention are two parameters that define the success of an e-commerce retailer. Big data helps you understand customer spending patterns, which can help you pitch customized offers to both old and new customers. Contrary to what skeptics might believe, big data is here to stay. With businesses taking their services online, we, at Intelligence Node help businesses make smart decisions by giving them the real-time data they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Using Data To Create A Better Experience</strong><br />\r\nData impacts every aspect of the e-commerce landscape. At ThirdLove, our data affects how we develop products, create the customer journey, and ensure that our customers have a great experience. Everything revolves around that.<br />\r\nSometimes women ask me how we&rsquo;re able to find them the right bra size using the Fit Finder on our website. With around six million women going through it, we&rsquo;ve got quite a bit of data to help find the right size.<br />\r\nAnd that&rsquo;s where the power of big data really lies for e-commerce&mdash;it creates a better experience. For example, we&rsquo;ve collected approximately 75 million data points just from our Fit Finder quiz. We use that data to influence nearly every aspect of our business. Each woman who takes the quiz adds something to it and makes our recommendations smarter.<br />\r\nE-commerce companies all have massive amounts of data at their disposal, and it&rsquo;s changing how they interact with customers.<br />\r\n<strong>Tracking Preferences</strong><br />\r\nThink of when someone walks into a brick and mortar store. The sales associate on the floor doesn&rsquo;t know who they are or what they need. They don&rsquo;t know if that customer is primed to buy, or if they&rsquo;re going to three more stores after this one to compare prices. It&rsquo;s very difficult for them to know all of that. But these types of things are apparent when customers shop online. If they allow cookies, then the company knows where they came from. They know if the customer saw an ad on Facebook or clicked on an email offer. They know if that customer has visited the site<br />\r\nbefore, put something in their cart, and then backed out. It&rsquo;s all available. This type of tracking allows e-commerce companies to target consumers who are of a certain age, who have a certain income, who like these types of products. They don&rsquo;t engage every single person who might wander into the store or those who aren&rsquo;t interested in<br />\r\nbuying. That enables companies to spend their money more effectively. Instead of putting up a billboard in Times Square and hoping the right people see it, they&rsquo;re using data to target the right consumers at the right times. And that&rsquo;s good for the customer, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Catering To Customers</strong><br />\r\nSometimes a woman will come to our website, take our Fit Finder quiz, and then decide not to buy anything. When she comes back, the calls to action for the Fit Finder will be gone. In its place, she might see products that fit her shape or size&mdash;specific content that&rsquo;s adapted for women like her. Big data allows us to personalize the customer journey by intelligently segmenting our customer base. It isn&rsquo;t 100% personalized to each individual, like many think. But with so many data points to draw from, we can tailor content to certain types of customers. It&rsquo;s more personal, and it<br />\r\nmakes sense from our standpoint and the customers.Our customers tell us: We want you to know who we are.<br />\r\nThey want to come back to our site and have an experience that reflects their previous visits. They want to get an email that talks about their preferred style and size. Without big data, we couldn&rsquo;t create that personalized experience.<br />\r\nBig data is the next frontier in e-commerce, but its uses revolve around one key question: Are you delivering value to your customer? It all revolves around creating a better digital experience than what they can get in a store.<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re that point, and big data is going to take us even further.</p>\r\n', 'CFGD1531820597.jpg', 'publish', '2018-07-17 15:13:17', '2018-07-17 15:13:31'),
